    The dataset which I found fascinating is Amazon Sales dataset —
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikramshah512/amazon-products-sales-dataset-42k-items-2025" target="_blank">
      My favourite dataset
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Its potential applications can be:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Data Visualization</b> – Used for creating reports using BI tools for sales analysis, KPI tracking, and monitoring.</li>
      <li><b>Recommendation Systems</b> – Build systems to suggest similar products to customers.</li>
      <li><b>Machine Learning Models</b> – Train models to predict if customers will like new products.</li>
      <li><b>Academic Purposes</b> – Useful for learning data modeling and ML since the dataset is clean.</li>
      <li><b>Forecasting Sales</b> – Predict sales by learning from historical data.</li>
    </ul>

    The book which I liked the most is
    <a href="https://nbviewer.org/urls/gist.github.com/fonnesbeck/5850463/raw/a29d9ffb863bfab09ff6c1fc853e1d5bf69fe3e4/3.+Plotting+and+Visualization.ipynb" target="_blank">
      My favourite book
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This book is about <b>data visualization</b> in Python, teaching libraries such as <i>matplotlib</i>, <i>chaco</i>, and <i>Pyx</i>.
    It explains how to build line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, and trellis plots, while showing how
    to use pandas and matplotlib for meaningful visualizations.
