    The dataset which I found fascinating is Amazon Sales dataset —
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikramshah512/amazon-products-sales-dataset-42k-items-2025" target="_blank">
      My favourite dataset
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Its potential applications can be:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Data Visualization</b> – Used for creating reports using BI tools for sales analysis, KPI tracking, and monitoring.</li>
      <li><b>Recommendation Systems</b> – Build systems to suggest similar products to customers.</li>
      <li><b>Machine Learning Models</b> – Train models to predict if customers will like new products.</li>
      <li><b>Academic Purposes</b> – Useful for learning data modeling and ML since the dataset is clean.</li>
      <li><b>Forecasting Sales</b> – Predict sales by learning from historical data.</li>
    </ul>

    The book which I liked the most is
    <a href="https://nbviewer.org/urls/gist.github.com/fonnesbeck/5850463/raw/a29d9ffb863bfab09ff6c1fc853e1d5bf69fe3e4/3.+Plotting+and+Visualization.ipynb" target="_blank">
      My favourite book
    </a>.

As this is a data visualization book which can teach alot about various libraries in python like matplotlib,chaco, Pyx which are famous tools used for creating charts, graphs, and other visuals for the sake of representing the data in a meaningful way. It talks in depth about various visuals like normal distribution, scatterplot chart, plotting visual using pandas daraframe, using matplotlib library to construct line charts, bar charts, histograms and other things which I feel is very useful for representing the data. It also introduces the working of Boxplots, Scatterplots, Trellis plots which cover in greater detail about their functionalities and how to plot them in python along with its codebase.
