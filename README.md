   <p>  The dataset which I found fascinating is Amazon Sales dataset-
<a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikramshah512/amazon-products-sales-dataset-42k-items-2025>My favourite dataset</a></p> 

<p>Its potential applications can be-
Data Visualization - The dataset can be used for creating reports using business intelligence tools for various purposes like sales analysis, KPI tracking, sales monitoring and other analytics purposes.
Recommendation Systems- This dataset can be used for building recommendation systems for customers to recommend the similar product to them they can buy based on their choices.
Machine Learning models- This system can be used to train machine learning models for predicting customers will like the new product or not.
Academic purposes- It can be used by students to learn data modeling and machine learning on this dataset as it is super cleaned.
Forecasting sales- This dataset can be used to predict sales by learning from previous data it has.</p>

<p>The book which I liked the most is <a href=https://nbviewer.org/urls/gist.github.com/fonnesbeck/5850463/raw/a29d9ffb863bfab09ff6c1fc853e1d5bf69fe3e4/3.+Plotting+and+Visualization.ipynb>My favourite book</a></p>

As this is a data visualization book which can teach alot about various libraries in python like matplotlib,chaco, Pyx which are famous tools used for creating charts, graphs, and other visuals for the sake of representing the data in a meaningful way.

It talks in depth about various visuals like normal distribution, scatterplot chart, plotting visual using pandas daraframe, using matplotlib library to construct line charts, bar charts, histograms and other things which I feel is very useful for representing the data. It also introduces the working of Boxplots, Scatterplots, Trellis plots which cover in greater detail about their functionalities and how to plot them in python along with its codebase.
